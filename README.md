# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

Well,This repo is for my personal use,But if you like it you can use.And More importantly it is not completed yet.

I like _Object Oriented Design_ .So every datastructure is implemented as a class and their operations are methods of the class.You need not be following that. I commented as much as possible. And I have added the common mistakes I would make as a part of the note.

Beaware of spelling mistakes :)

Another thing is Everyone has their unique way of studying and learning.This is not a complete guide or something like that. It is just my work for my reference.
