POINTERS
    Pointer store address of the variable
    Size of pointer is fixed and depends on system..In 32bit machine pointer size is 32bit.
    Saves space



DOUBLE POINTER
Pointer to the pointer
Node** temp;

Double pointer can access to two locations:
1.Pointer           - temp
2.Value at pointer  - *temp

For Example:
    Node** temp = &head;
        Using variable "temp"  I can move the head pointer
        Using variabel "*temp" I can change the value of head pointer

temp  is like current pointer
temp* is like next pointer

Using Double pointer I can access the next element from the Previous element

Using Double pointer we can avoid the use of special if condition for the head during insertion and deletion
