QUEUE
    FIFO - First In First Out Strategy
    Two Pointer - FRONT & REAR (generally)
    IMPLEMENTATION
        1.Array
        2.Singly Linked List
        3.Circular Linked List
        |   Using Circular linked list we can use implement the queue using single Pointer
    APPLICATION
        Ready Queue in OS
        Waiting Queue
