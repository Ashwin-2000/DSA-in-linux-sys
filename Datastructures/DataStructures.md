# DATA STRUCTURES - An Intro

> Data Structures - _Structuring the data_

The data can be any thing

- It can be weight of student in the class
- It can be marks of students
- It can be objects of class car

We have a zillon of Data in our world.But simple ocean of data is useless
unless it is churned into information

- Data - _collection of facts_

- Information - _collection of releated and meaningful data_

> The DATA STRUCTURES evolved by storing the data in such a way so that we can retive the information in easy way
> The DATA STRUCTURES are just a way to represent the data.

Data Structures types :

1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non Linear Data Structures

> _Linearity and Non Linearity is not based memory allocation_ :
> It is not about contagious or non-contagious memory allocation
> It is about the connection of data in linear or branched fashion

Linear Data Structures :

1. Array
2. [Linked List](https://github.com/Ashwin-2000/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/tree/master/Datastructures/Linked%20List)
3. Stack
4. Queue

Non Linerar Data Structures :

1. Trees
   - N-ary Tree
   - Binary Tree
   - Binary Search Tree
   - Heap/Priority Queue/Binary HEap
   - Balanced Search Trees (General concepts not details)
   - Traversals : Preorder,Inorder,Postroder,BFS,DFS
2. Hash table
3. Graph

- Directed
- Undirected
- Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List
- Traversel : BFS , DFS

Don't get too exhaustive on seeing this...the topics that are marked are not implemented but you should know about it. Most of the interviews dont expect students to implement these marked topic but they think the students must be aware of it.

The Most funniest thing of all is each data structure is used to represent other.For example,the Graph can be implemented using Matrix(Array of Array) and also using Adjacency List(Vector of Vector).

Why this much data structures and more ?

- Because of the different types of applications and usecases
- In some application we need to find things faster than inserting the data. In some we need to insert in fastest possible way
- Like this for vairous application and use caes data strucuters differ the above are most common and depending on the usecase
- we construct any type of data structure
