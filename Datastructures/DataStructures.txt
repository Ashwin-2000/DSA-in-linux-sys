DATA STRUCTURES

Data Structures - Structuring the data
The data can be any thing 
    -It can be weight of student in the class
    -It can be marks of students 
    -It can be objects of class
    Anything we can relate to one another

We have a zillon of Data in our world.But simple ocean of data is useless 
unless it is churned into information

Data         - collection of facts
Information  - collection of releated and meaningful data

The DATA STRUCTURES evolved by storing the data in such a way so that we can retive the information in easy way
The DATA DTRUCTURES are just a way to represent the data.

Data Structures types :
    Linear Data Structures 
    Non Linear Data Structures

Linear Data Structures : 
    1.Array
    2.Linked List
        Singly Linked List
        Doubly Linked List
        Circular Linked List
    3.Auxillary Data types
        Stacks
        Queues
            Dequeue
            Priority Queue

Non Linerar Data Structures : 
    Trees
        Tree
        Splay Tree
        B-Tree
        N-ary Tree
        B+ and B- tree
        Binary Tree
            Complete Binary Tree
            Full Binary Tree
            Binary Search Tree
            Balanced Binary Tree
                AVL Tree
                Red-Black Tree
    Head Data Structures
        priority queues ??
    Hash table
    Graph
        
The Important thing these are representation of datas and one data structure might us another in their 
implementation.

Why this much data structures and more ? 
    -Because of the different types of applications and usecases
    In some application we need to find things faster than inserting the data.In some we need to insert in fastest possible way
    Like this for vairous application and use caes data strucuters differ the above are most common and depending on the usecase 
    we construct any type of data structure


Linearity and Non Linearity is not based memory allocation :
    It is not about contagious or non-contagious memory allocation
    It is about the connection of data in linear or branched fashion
