## Classification of trees

- By maximum number of branches

  - Binary Tree - Atmost two Branches(Childrens)
  - Ternary Tree - Atmost three Branches(Childrens)
  - N-Ary Tree - Atmost 'n' Branches(Childrens)

- By Heights of Subtree

  - Balanced Tree
  - Unbalanced Tree

## Special Trees

- Empty-tree : a tree without any node
- Root-tree : a tree with only one node
- Binary Search Tree : a tree with condition _**Left_child < Parent < Right_child**_
- Heap : a tree where parent node is greater(or smaller) than children
- B- & B+ Tree : indexing in Database
- Trie : Called as **digital tree or prefix tree** used for locating specific keys from within the set.
- suffix tree : For quick pattern searching
